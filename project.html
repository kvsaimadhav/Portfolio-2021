								COVID-19 Prediction has become necessary for Hospitals to estimate number of people affecting due to coronavirus. Build Web Application for the covid-19 prediction done by using Machine Learning Algorithm package designed by FaceBook named as "Prophet". Achieved an accuracy of 95% for using the algorithm for dataset downloaded from covid-tracking project conducted by US officials. Web Application built is done by python-django package as part of backend development of website. Successfully able to satisfy professors Dr. Lisa Gandy and Dr. Patrick Kinnicutt as part of the course ITC 691 (Information Technology Project).

								DDoS attack happens inorder to make users unaccessible with a website like amazon.com, google.com, facebook.com and so on. Build a mechanism for resolution of DDoS attack by using Naive Bayes Machine Learning algorithm for determining whether a user is DDoS user or not. The accuracy of the naive bayes approach has given 85% with false positive rates as 6% which are further tackled by designing a website. Built a web application for eliminating the false positive rates from the naive bayes algorithm using python-django package. Succesfully able to satisfy professor Dr. Qi Liao as part of the course ITC 520 (Foundations of Computer Security).
